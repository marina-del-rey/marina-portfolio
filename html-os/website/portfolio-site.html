                        young age, I've been passionate about computing, which led me to explore different areas such as
                        machine learning, game development and IoT. These experiences have given me a broad perspective
                        on the many possibilites technology can offer.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        I eventually discovered my passion for web development because it perfectly combines creativity
                        and computing. I enjoy crafting websites that are both functional and engaging, as they play a
                        critical role in helping users connect with businesses and projects. I’ve worked with a variety
                        of technologies, including React, Django, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, Spring
                        Boot, Express.js, SCSS, MongoDB, MySQL, Docker, and Vite, amongst others. These tools
                        have allowed me to explore different approaches to web development.

                    <p class="text">
                        I recently earned my bachelor's degree in Informatics Engineering from the Faculty of Sciences
                        of the University of Lisbon, where I built a strong foundation in areas like algorithms and data
                        structures, databases, human-computer interaction, distributed systems and artifical
                        intelligence. My coursework also included projects in software engineering, computer networks,
                        security, and computer graphics.

                        Outside of coding, I enjoy singing, writing poetry, taking analog photos, drawing cats, and
                        reading. I'm also passionate about personal growth and constantly look for ways to learn and
                        improve. I’m excited to bring my skills and creativity to new and exciting projects!
